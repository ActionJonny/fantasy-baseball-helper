## Fantasy Baseball Helper
## Project Status
  This is definitely a passion project for me. For someone that is in four fantasy baseball leagues, I have needed something to help me stay organized and help me draft based on what categories each of my leagues has. Fantasy baseball helper is that application

## Reflection
  - This is my personal project for mod3
  - I wanted to create an app that can rank players based on what categories your fantasy baseball league offers
  - I know the project looks plain, but I learned a lot about scraping the web and trouble shooting in my webpack.config. I       would have been terrified to open webpack prior to this project.
  - My biggest issues was trying to put my nightmare method into my actions. I was also having issues putting it on heroku,       but I don't know too much about the backend, so that issue was a little harder to resolve.
  - Nightmare.js, React, React Router, React Redux

This was a ten day project I built during my third module at Turing School of Software and Design. During this project I wanted to work on web scraping with nightmare.js. At the time I started this project I had only done one project in Redux and React-Router 4.0, so I really wanted to work with those two tools again.

I ran into an issue using nightmare - no pun intended - and baseball-reference. My first several attempts were only giving me the players name, after some research I found out I can change the viewport size and was able to collect all the data I needed for my project. The next challenge I have is building a backend so I can have users login and select players they want to target in their draft. I have been looking at the backend we used during our movie-tracker application and I am really excited to build my own backend.
